// Placeholder Playwright test spec (conceptual). Real execution requires building extension first.
// This file shows intended structure; running it depends on having @playwright/test set up via its own runner, not bun:test.
/**
 * To run (manual example):
 * npx playwright test tests/e2e/extension.spec.ts
 */

// Actual Playwright tests are not executed via Bun's test runner.
