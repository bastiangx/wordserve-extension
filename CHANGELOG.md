## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- This initial 'CHANGELOG.md' file

### Fixed

- Some useful links were incorrectly blocked due to overly broad domain matching in `types.ts`

### Changed

- Menu rendering logic slightly better, handles edge cases in super long input fields with lots of texts

### Removed

- Wrong domain examples
- Leftover `console.info` logs in `content.ts`
-  `scripting` permission from `wxt.config.ts` as it was not used
